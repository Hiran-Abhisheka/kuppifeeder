## 🔐 Security

### API Key Protection

- ✅ **Local Credentials** — Supabase keys stored in `.env` (never committed)
- ✅ **Environment Variables** — Loaded at runtime via `flutter_dotenv`
- ✅ **Gitignore Protection** — `.env` excluded from version control
- ✅ **Template Provided** — `.env.example` for safe collaboration

### Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env`** to version control
2. **Regenerate** Supabase keys if accidentally exposed
3. **Use `.env.example`** to document required variables
4. **Rotate credentials** periodically in production

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflows

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for automated testing, building, and security scanning.

#### 1. **CI Workflow** (`ci.yml`)

Runs on every push to `main` or `develop` branches and on pull requests.

**Jobs:**

- ✅ **Analyze** — Dart code analysis and formatting check
- ✅ **Test** — Unit tests with coverage reporting
- ✅ **Build Android** — Automated APK build (release)
- ✅ **Build iOS** — Automated iOS build (no code sign)
- ✅ **Build Web** — Automated web build

**Artifacts Generated:**

- `kuppifeed-release.apk` — Android release build
- `kuppifeed-ios-release/` — iOS build directory
- `kuppifeed-web-release/` — Web build directory

#### 2. **Security Workflow** (`security.yml`)

Runs on push, pull requests, and weekly schedule.

**Jobs:**

- 🔍 **Dependency Scan** — Check for outdated packages
- 🚨 **Secret Detection** — Scan for exposed credentials (TruffleHog)
